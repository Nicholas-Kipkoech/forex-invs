# Risk Management

Protecting your capital is more important than chasing profits.  
Risk management ensures you survive long enough to trade successfully.

---

## 1. Position Sizing

- Never risk more than 1–2% of your account on a single trade.  
- Calculate trade size based on stop-loss distance and account balance.

**Formula:**  

Position Size = (Account Balance * Risk %) / Stop Loss (in $)


---

## 2. Stop-Loss & Take-Profit

- **Stop-Loss (SL)** – Limits losses if the market moves against you  
- **Take-Profit (TP)** – Automatically locks in gains  

Always define SL/TP before entering a trade.

---

## 3. Risk-Reward Ratio

- Aim for trades where potential reward > risk  
- Common ratio: 2:1 or 3:1 (risking $100 to make $200–$300)

---

## 4. Diversification

- Don’t put all capital into a single asset or market  
- Spread risk across instruments, sectors, or strategies

---

## 5. Emotional Control

- Stick to your plan  
- Avoid revenge trading or chasing losses  
- Consistency beats impulsive trades

---

## Conclusion

Risk management is the backbone of long-term trading.  
Protect your account, and profits will follow naturally.
